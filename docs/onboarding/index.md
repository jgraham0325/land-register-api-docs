## Introduction
{: .govuk-heading-l #introduction}

Many thanks for signing up to be part of Private Beta – we are excited to be working closely with you on Street Manager.
{: .govuk-body}

Your Private Beta Manager is Esme Moore, who will be your primary contact for all things related to Private Beta. (See the Communication channels section for more details)
{: .govuk-body}

In this Onboarding Induction Pack, you will find details about the scope and timelines of Street Manager, your roles and responsibilities, important information about communication channels, the FAQ and what information we plan to produce and have available to you during this phase.

## About Street Manager
{: .govuk-heading-l #about-street-manager}

In early 2017, the DfT began to investigate whether or not the current system for managing street works was fit for purpose in terms of the technology it uses, the needs of the user community and the rising demand for up to date and accurate data about road works. People were reporting frustrations about:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>the timeliness and accuracy of data</li>
  <li>high costs</li>
  <li>the need for updates to reflect current needs and</li>
  <li>inconsistent systems and data.</li>
</ol>

To address the gap, the DfT worked with users from local authorities and utility companies to design and develop a new digital service - Street Manager - that would enable a single source of accurate, up-to-date and open data on road and street works with the vision of transforming the planning, management and communication of street and road works to ultimately minimise disruption and improve journeys for the public. The image below shows the benefits of the new service.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

## Ways of working - Agile product delivery
{: .govuk-heading-l #ways-of-working}

In line with Government Digital Service (GDS) guidelines, the Street Manager project is being conducted in an agile way, meaning that we are following an iterative development approach. 
{: .govuk-body}

We build the basics of the product first and then, based on regular user testing feedback, we enhance as we go. It provides the ability to adapt the product to meet changing requirements all the time. This means that you as users get to access the new system earlier on but also for us to adapt the system continuously. Rather than a fixed system that may be missing a few things, you get an organic one that can be added to as and when needed. The analogy we like to use is of building a house - you build the basic walls and roof first so that you can move in straight away but then you can choose what curtains or kitchen tiles you want when you’ve moved in.
{: .govuk-body}

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

## Street Manager phases timeline
{: .govuk-heading-l #street-manager-phases-timeline}

Street Manager is now in the Beta development phase. This is when we build, test and roll out the service. The Beta development phase is split into private beta, where we work with a closed group of users, and then public beta which is when other users can start using the service.
{: .govuk-body}

![phases timeline](images/phases-timeline.png)

In line with feedback from users, we have reduced the public beta phase to five months to help minimise the transition issues, such as dual running. It will now be between November and March 2020, when legislation will be changed to make Street Manager the sole service that should be used. The DfT hopes to publish a consultation shortly that will provide more information on the legislative changes.
{: .govuk-body}

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

## Progress so far
{: .govuk-heading-l #progress-so-far}

We have had 15 users from 5 organisations involved in the pilot group, which has been running since November 2018. These users primarily focussed on the web frontend and have been using real life examples to test Street Manager to help us to develop the various services. We have carried out 14 onsite visits during the pilot phase to observe pilot users. Since the start of the pilot in November, over 380 Slack messages have been exchanged. Our pilot users have:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Created 720 work permits</li>
  <li>Raised 750 permit applications</li>
  <li>Granted 405 permits and refused 73 applications</li>
  <li>Commented on 79 permits</li>
</ol>

We are very grateful to Thames Water, Cadent, Transport for London, Hertfordshire and UK Power Networks for their contributions so far.

## Private Beta timeline
{: .govuk-heading-l #private-beta-timeline}

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

## Move to Production
{: .govuk-heading-l #move-to-production}

All private beta users will begin in the SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT. You may dual-key and/or to test with dummy data.
{: .govuk-body}

When you are ready, you can request access to the PRE-PRODUCTION and PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. Instead of dummy email addresses like those that were provided for SANDBOX, we will be using your users’ email addresses as the login username. Please avoid using dummy data within PRE-PRODUCTION and treat it as if it was the live system.
{: .govuk-body}

Two weeks’ notice will be required when you would like to move onto PRE-PRODUCTION/PRODUCTION. We will also need to ensure that you are paired up with a works promoter and local highway authority (LHA) within your geographical area accordingly.
{: .govuk-body}

Important: If you dual-key in EToN and the PRODUCTION, there will be duplicate records in the live system which may cause side affects in other services such duplicate works in [roadworks.org](https://roadworks.org). If this is necessary you should make other organisations aware so they can prevent this.
{: .govuk-body}
