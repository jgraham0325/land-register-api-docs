## Introduction
{: .govuk-heading-l #introduction}

This is the API guidance documentation for Street Manager, intended as a guide for developers integrating their systems to submit and retrieve information about street works. It is intended as a technical guide to be used with the API definition documentation and not a business change guide.
{: .govuk-body}

![System context diagram](images/system-context.png)

The Street Manager APIs are RESTful APIs to read/write data to the centralised Street Manager system following [GDS guidelines](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards), not a peer to peer solution.

## Swagger Documentation
{: .govuk-heading-l #swagger-documentation}

The services APIs are documented and defined using <a href="https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/">OpenAPI Specification Version 2 (Swagger)</a>. This allows developers to get the full technical detail for the API endpoints, including Request/Response object definitions. The Swagger JSON includes comments for field validation rules and references to the business rules. You can use the files to <a href="https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/">generate interface code</a> for your chosen language.
{: .govuk-body}

The Swagger JSON files for each API are available below:

**Please be aware of the following:**
{: .govuk-body}

If you attempt to validate the above swagger files using the online tool <a href="https://editor.swagger.io"> https://editor.swagger.io </a> or `swagger-cli`, you may see schema errors. Please note we are aware of this issue and it will not stop you from being able to generate mock server/clients. We aim to fix this in a future version.
{: .govuk-body}

Swagger UI does not display all description text for enumerations and child elements, instead check each of the swagger.json files above for full description text.

## Environments
{: .govuk-heading-l #environments}

The Street Manager service provides two separate isolated application service environments.  Both of these environments contains a full stack deployment of Street Manager and are designated for specific purposes, as outlined below.
{: .govuk-body}


![Service environments](images/service-environments-1.png)


### SANDBOX environment
{: .govuk-heading-m  #sandbox-env}

API URL: https://api.sandbox.stwrks-dev.net
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>SANDBOX environment is primarily intended as an integration testing environment for API integrators and an initial orientation environment for organisations intending to use the Street Manager web frontend.</li>
  <li>Each Public Beta participant organisation will be provided with credentials as part of the initial onboarding process.  User credentials can be valid for either the Street Manager web frontend, or the Street Manager API interfaces - not both at the same time.  In order to have existing credentials reconfigured for API access, please contact the Street Manager service desk.</li>
  <li>Organisations who are not a recognised Street Works Authority (do not have a SWA code, Contractor/Vendors etc.) may test using accounts for associated Street Works Authority organisations.</li>
  <li>Organisations intending to use only the Street Manager web frontend can leverage SANDBOX environment to test end-to-end permit journeys and familiarise their staff with the service.</li>
  <li>API integration developers can leverage the SANDBOX environment to access the latest Swagger documentation for the available API endpoints, as well as test their API clients against the Street Manager API services from their CI integration environment.</li>
  <li>Organisations are permitted to leverage SANDBOX for additional assurance activities such as focussed end-user testing, however no form of performance testing is permitted against this environment.  Organisations who wish to carry out performance testing must contact the Street Manager project team directly in order to discuss options.</li>
  <li>SANDBOX is development-grade, therefore a) is subject to higher-velocity changes and releases; b) is not guaranteed to be highly-available nor highly-performant; c) may be subject to occasional resets of the underlying databases.</li>
  <li><b>Organisations and their users of Street Manager must agree not to submit sensitive nor personally identifiable data into the SANDBOX environment under any circumstances – only use of ‘dummy’ data is permitted.</b></li>
</ol>


### PRODUCTION environment
{: .govuk-heading-m #production-env}

API URL: https://api.manage-roadworks.service.gov.uk
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>The PRODUCTION environment is <b>for LIVE use and LIVE data only</b> – neither functional nor non-functional testing is permitted against the live environment.</li>
  <li>Once an organisation has reached production-readiness – and have aligned with their local area ecosystem partners in that production-readiness – the organisations must engage with the Street Manager team to inform them of their production readiness.  At this stage the team will work with the organisation to facilitate a transition into the PRODUCTION environment.</li>
  <li>In some cases, local area ecosystem alignment may not be possible within reasonable timeframes due to external factors.  In these cases, dual-keying may be necessary between the organisation, their existing EToN system, and the Street Manager Service.</li>
</ol>


<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

## Connecting to the API services
{: .govuk-heading-l #connecting}

In order to connect to the Street Manager environments, your API client must be configured to connect to an environment-specific API URL via [HTTPS](#https).
{: .govuk-body}

It is important to note that the hostname within the URL contains a DNS CNAME. Due to the nature of Street Manager's highly-available cloud-native design, <b>the underlying IP addresses resolved from this CNAME are subject to change frequently and without notice.</b>
{: .govuk-body}

Therefore, if your IT department restrict outbound internet access from your API client to the Street Manager service via a perimeter firewall or some other means, it is important that access to Street Manager is whitelisted on the basis of the DNS CNAME and not the transient underlying IP addresses.
{: .govuk-body}

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">

## Timing
{: .govuk-heading-l #timing}

All Street Manager environments use standard [NTP Pool](https://www.ntppool.org/en/) servers to synchronise their system clocks, ensuring they keep accurate and consistent time. To learn more about how Street Manager uses time and defines rules like working day, see the [Business rules](/street-manager-docs/articles/business-rules-version-1-15.html).

## Technical Overview
{: .govuk-heading-l #technical-overview}

### Available APIs
{: .govuk-heading-m}

![Getting data](images/getting-data-1.png)

Street Manager exposes a number of APIs to allow external applications
to retrieve and submit data.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Work API
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The Street Manager Work API allows promoters and highway authority
users to carry out a number of key workflows relevant to their
organization and role. We will cover each in detail but at a high level
they are:
{: .govuk-body}

**Promoter workflows**
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Submit permit application</li>
  <li>Submit forward plan</li>
  <li>Carry out a work</li>
  <li>Create reinstatement</li>
  <li>Action an FPN</li>
  <li>Add comments to a works record</li>
  <li>Submit a permit alteration (change-request, work extension)</li>
</ol>

**Highway Authority workflows**
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Assess permit application</li>
  <li>Issue an inspection</li>
  <li>Schedule reinspections</li>
  <li>Issue an FPN</li>
  <li>Submit event and highway license activities</li>
  <li>Add comments to a works record</li>
</ol>

In order to ensure a user has the appropriate permissions to carry out
the above workflows they must authenticate to the API and acquire a JWT
to be used as part of their request.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Street Lookup API
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The Street Manager Street Lookup API allows querying of NSG and ASD data
based on location and USRN. This function is only available as part of
submitting a permit for a work. See the resource guide for details.
{: .govuk-body}

#### GeoJson API
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The Street Manager GeoJson API exposes works and events spatial data to
authenticated users for use with mapping queries. This API returns data in the form of [GeoJSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-4) using BNG (British National Grid [EPSG:27700](https://epsg.io/27700)) as the Coordinate Reference System, as per Street Works industry standard. See the resource guide for details.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Data Export API
{: .govuk-heading-s}

Street Manager supports an API for Open Data users. The Data Export API allows non street works authority users, such as Mobile Application developers, to retrieve information about works. See Open Data and the resource guide for details.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Reporting API
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The reporting API allows promoters and highway authority users to carry
out a number of data analysis and reporting workflows, allowing them to
retrieve data with configurable filtering, sorting and paging. This is
the backbone of our dashboard and list functionality. This API should be
used as a primary API to retrieve large volumes of data about your
works.
{: .govuk-body}

### Getting data from Street Manager
{: .govuk-heading-m #getting-data-from-street-manager}

External systems integrating with Street Manager need to retrieve data
from the service to give their users the most up-to-date view on what is
going on with their works. Street Manager has a number of ways which you
can extract data from the service.
{: .govuk-body}

**Individual work data**
{: .govuk-body}

The Work API provides endpoints which give the full detail available
for individual Works and Permits. Use these endpoints to retrieve
details such as timings, comments, history and changes.
{: .govuk-body}

**Reporting**
{: .govuk-body}

You can use the Data Export API to extract data from the service in
CSV format. These endpoints allow you to extract most Work
information efficiently for your organisation.
{: .govuk-body}

**Continuous** **Polling**
{: .govuk-body}

The reporting API exposes a `/works/updates` endpoint for polling. See the resource guide for full information.
{: .govuk-body}

**Notifications**
{: .govuk-body}

*Note: Notifications are currently in roadmap for future release (post April 2020).*
{: .govuk-body}

Street Manager will offer a Notification service which will send Push
notifications to organisations for updates to their Works to subscribed
systems. Organisations who wish to receive notifications need to expose
an HTTPS endpoint capable of receiving POST requests from the
Notification service containing the update event data as JSON.
{: .govuk-body}

Notifications cannot offer guaranteed delivery (network issues, service
downtime etc.) so to reconcile for missed Notifications you can use the
Polling API endpoint to validate you have received notifications for all
updated works.
{: .govuk-body}

**Contractors**
{: .govuk-body}

Contractors can use the Data Export API to extract data from the service in CSV format. These endpoints allow you to extract most Work information efficiently for the organisation you are working on behalf of. <code>swa_code</code> parameters are available on the endpoints which can be used by contractors to provide the SWA code of the promoter they are working on behalf of. Additionally, contractors can carry out promoter workflows via the <code>work-api</code>.
{: .govuk-body}

**Open Data**
{: .govuk-body}

Street Manager maintains an hourly scheduled job, which retrieves data of permits that have been added or changed in the past hour, and stores it as CSV. This data is only available to data export users.
{: .govuk-body}

The CSV will contain:
{: .govuk-body}
<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Work reference number</li>
  <li>Permit reference number</li>
  <li>Promoter SWA code</li>
  <li>Promoter organisation</li>
  <li>Highway authority</li>
  <li>Works location coordinates (in <a title="Well-known Text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry">WKT</a> format)</li>
  <li>Works location description</li>
  <li>Street name</li>
  <li>Area name</li>
  <li>Work category</li>
  <li>Description of work</li>

## Versioning and Release Management
{: .govuk-heading-l #versioningandreleasemanagement}

During Public Beta and beyond, the Street Manager services will remain under continual active development.  Therefore, a process must be established which allows low-friction development to continue at pace, whilst providing the option for web frontend users and API integrators to focus on a higher-stability version of the services.
{: .govuk-body}

This section aims to describe the approach taken by the Street Manager team in order to meet both of those requirements.  The approach is based upon existing GDS [best practices](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/26/considering-our-approach-to-api-iteration/) and will undergo continual refinement over time, based on feedback from the consumers of the service environments as well as observations by the Street Manager project team.
{: .govuk-body}


### API Versioning Approach
{: .govuk-heading-m}

The Street Manager API services will be versioned via the URL path, for example <code>api.sandbox.domain.com/v1/works/.../</code> versus <code>api.sandbox.domain.com/v2/works/.../</code>.  Initially, the Public Beta will focus on the <code>v1</code> major version of the codebase, with new major versions being introduced at a later date.
{: .govuk-body}



### Release Management
{: .govuk-heading-m}

As described in the section above, initially only <code>v1</code> of the Street Manager API services will be available within the environments.  Minor version updates will be released into <code>v1</code> every two weeks - these updates may include existing feature enhancements, entirely new feature additions, as well as issue hotfixes.  Although regular releases will continue throughout Public Beta, the Street Manager development team will strive to minimise the number of breaking changes where possible.
{: .govuk-body}

It should however be noted that during Public Beta development, there remains the potential that breaking changes may occasionally be required in order to release corrective hotfixes deemed to be service critical.  In such situations, the project team will notify potentially affected participant organistations in advance of the release and provide support with a view to minimising disruption.
{: .govuk-body}

The following are examples of what we consider to be breaking and non-breaking changes.
{: .govuk-body}

#### What is a breaking change
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>Adding new mandatory field to existing endpoint request object</li>
<li>Removing/renaming enum value for field in existing endpoint request object</li>
<li>Removing/renaming existing field in endpoint response object</li>
<li>Adding new required endpoint to use an existing flow (e.g. submitting a permit)</li>
</ol>

#### What is a non-breaking change
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>Adding a new optional field to existing endpoint request object</li>
<li>Adding new enum values for field in existing endpoint request object</li>
<li>Adding new data to response objects (accepting risk that this breaks some formal contract JSON deserialisers)</li>
<li>Adding a new endpoint to support new functionality or an enhancement to existing functionality</li>
</ol>

When the first participant organisations are approaching production readiness, <code>v1</code> will be 'locked down' to ensure only non-breaking hotfixes and additive enhancements are permitted into the codebase.  At this point in time, a <code>v2</code> version will be published alongside <code>v1</code> in the SANDBOX environment alongside updated Swagger JSON definitions - this is aimed at parties interested in tracking Street Manager development more closely. Similiar to <code>v1</code>, updates will be released into <code>v2</code> every two weeks, and whilst the Street Manager development team will strive to minimise them, the occasional breaking change may be required in order to release critical fixes.

## Integration guide
{: .govuk-heading-l #integration-guide}

This section is a brief guide on how to design your API integration with Street Manager with some best practises and guidance.
{: .govuk-body}

### Integration for an organisations line of business application
{: .govuk-heading-s}

An example of this would be a new or existing line of business application used by many users in an organisation involved in street works. The application could have many functions specific to the organisation and complex case management workflows, but also need to submit and retrieve data about street works to Street Manager. Many users in the organisation use the application to interact with their organisations street works but do not necessarily have UI accounts to
{: .govuk-body}

![diagram line of business application](images/diagram-line-of-business-application.png)

In this case the application will need an API account created for the service user (or two if acting as both an HA and Promoter). This account will be for API use only, assigned with permissions appropriate for all organisation users and should identifiable as a service account. Internal system user identifiers should be passed via the `internal_user_identifier` and `internal_user_name` in POST/PUT requests to allow Street Manager to record and display who performed actions submitted from your system.
{: .govuk-body}

Applications should use a synchronous approach for submitting and updating items, calling the API when a user makes a significant change that would affect a work, as the user may miss an error returned by API (validation/duplicate data etc.) if updates are pushed onto a backround queue.
{: .govuk-body}

If notifcations for changes to items (e.g. Permit rejections/comments) to organisation users are required, the application should monitor Street Manager for updates. See the [Getting data from Street Manager](#getting-data-from-street-manager) section for details on this.
{: .govuk-body}

### Integration for software acting for a single user
{: .govuk-heading-s}

An example of this would be an application used to submit or retrieve information on works relating to a single user calling the Street Manager API synchronously, such as a mobile application used by an  inspector to view permit details and submit inspection results.
{: .govuk-body}

![diagram single user application](images/diagram-single-user-application.png)

The users for this application should be setup as both UI/API users. These accounts should not be shared between users, so actions carried out by the user can be traced back to individuals.
{: .govuk-body}

### Integration for extracting reporting data on street works
{: .govuk-heading-s}

An example of this would be an application used by an organisation to extract specific street work data for organisation specific reporting. This could be for automating operational reports that are generated on a scheduled basis.
{: .govuk-body}

![diagram reporting application](images/diagram-re
porting-application.png)

This account should use an individual API service account with only permissions to retrieve necessary data for reporting, not a shared account used by other systems. This ensures that the account cannot accidentally submit information or affect your other systems integration.
{: .govuk-body}

### Authentication best practises
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    You should not re-authenticate each time you make an API call. The same authentication token should be used for multiple API calls until it expires.
  </li>
  <li>
    The refresh token given in the <code>/authenticate</code> endpoint has a much longer expiry than the id token, you should store and use it to get a new id token when it expires via the Party API <code>/party/refresh</code> endpoint. This avoids needing to re-authenticate with credentials, useful if using user supplied credentials, and reduces unnecessary load on the systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    Logging in again will not invalidate a previous token. To explicitly invalidate all a users tokens you must call the Party API <code>/party/logout</code> endpoint.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are system limits on the number of concurrent authentication requests, so you should have exception handling to retry authentication using a sensible exponential back-off algorithm in case the service is busy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not use the same API credentials for multiple systems, as makes calls from different systems appear to come from the same source and risks multiple systems going down if the shared user is disabled.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update your passwords for API accounts on a sensible schedule.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not store or send passwords and tokens in plain text.
  </li>
  <li>
    See the <a href="#jwt">JWT</a> section for full details on authentication.
  </li>
</ol>


### Rate limiting and error handling best practises
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    Street Manager uses rate limiting for denial of service protection, see <a href="#rate-limiting">rate limiting</a> section for details.
  </li>
  <li>
    Employ a sensible retry policy for your API call failures to avoid cascading failures, where you repeatedly retry many failed calls at the same time continually triggering rate limiting <code>429</code> errors. Use a sensible exponential back-off algorithm in case the service is busy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>GET</code> calls can be retried without side effects within rate limit constraints, but repeating <code>POST</code> and <code>PUT</code> calls could cause duplicate data. Your error handling logic on important submit/update calls should check error responses to ensure the call did not complete a transaction.
  </li>
</ol>


<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible">


## Testing
{: .govuk-heading-l #testing}

#### Environments and usage
{: .govuk-heading-s}

See the <a href="#environments">Environments</a> section for details on the environments. If you require non-functional performance or security testing please contact Street Manager support to agree scope, volumes and scheduling beforehand, as this may have an impact on other users and each environment has specific rate limiting and protective controls which may invalidate your tests.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Recommended testing strategy
{: .govuk-heading-s #recommended-testing-strategy}

Our recommendation for organisations who want to start testing Street Manager is to get access to the SANDBOX environment and test in collaborative groups that reflect their normal operational area and actions. This allows more realistic test scenarios and will help better understand how other organisations plan to use Street Manager.
{: .govuk-body}

This will not always be possible and organisations may need to test using accounts for other organisations in order to test certain scenarios independently (e.g. a Utility company using a HA account to assess a permit they submitted). To enable this we will allow organisations to request accounts for other organisations with some restrictions to prevent conflicts in testing between organisations test data. See below for recommendations per type of organisation for independent testing.
{: .govuk-body}

    <p class="govuk-body">
    Request an HA account for a HA which you normally interact with and submit permits using a specific Workstream which identifies your test permits from the HA's own test data. This allows the HA to differentiate between your test data and their own. Use your HA account to respond to your Workstream permits and test your scenarios. You will need permission from the HA to do this and must liaise with the HA to ensure your testing does not interfere with their testing.

#### Reporting issues
{: .govuk-heading-s}

In order to correct issues and bugs found in Street Manager we require specific information so we can trace and attempt to reproduce errors.
{: .govuk-body}

Details will be provided to you at onboarding regarding how to report issues, the format and information required.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Generating test client and server stubs
{: .govuk-heading-s}

It is possible to generate test clients and servers using the available API documentation (Swagger JSON) which can be retrieved directly from the exposed APIs in SANDBOX environments. This allows isolated testing of your integration without dependency on test environments and can speed up development.
{: .govuk-body}

[Swagger-codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) supports generating client and server stubs for a variety of languages, see here for details. Below is an example of generating Java client and server stubs using the [Swagger-codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) utility.

## Security
{: .govuk-heading-l #security}

### HTTPS
{: .govuk-heading-m #https}

All Street Manager web and API interfaces are secured using Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.2
certificates issued by Amazon Web Services.  These certificates are signed by the 'Amazon Root CA 1' certificate as listed in the 'Certification Authorities' section of the [AWS Chain of Trust](https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/) document.
{: .govuk-body}

When sending requests to the Street Manager APIs the URL must start with <code>https://</code>. Requests sent with <code>http://</code> will result in an error.
{: .govuk-body}

### Authentication and Authorisation
{: .govuk-heading-m}

All resource endpoints in the API, with the exception of authentication and
status, require a [JWT](#jwt) to be passed in the \'token\' header of the
request. The [JWT](#jwt) contains information about the user and allows them to
access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.
Without it the request will be met with a 401 error response.
{: .govuk-body}

A <code>systemToken</code> API key is also available on the Party API, this token is for internal use only and is not required for any exposed endpoint.
{: .govuk-body}

### User accounts and permissions
{: .govuk-heading-m}

External systems integrating with Street Manager should use specific
credentials setup for API users. This is to allow Street Manager to
differentiate between Web UI user accounts and API users. User accounts
are assigned specific roles, such as *planner* and *admin*.
{: .govuk-body}

Each user can perform read operations to every resource, however write
operations are restricted based on a user's role and the organisation they are
associated with.
{: .govuk-body}

**Note:** *Currently systems who need to act as users associated with
multiple organisations, i.e. submitting permits for multiple utility
companies, **need to use separate user accounts for each organisation**.*
{: .govuk-body}

The table below shows the current permissions per endpoint.

\* An Organisation Member is a user with a SWA code matching the permit's
<code>highway_authority_swa_code</code> or <code>promoter_swa_code</code>. This
is enforced in addition to the user's role.
{: .govuk-body}

### JWT
{: .govuk-heading-m}

Json Web Token (JWT) is an open standard for exchanging information
securely. The entities of Street Manager exchange information using JWTs
and resources of the Street Manager API require that a JWT ID token be provided
as part of the request.
{: .govuk-body}

The JWT is validated per service per request. Every service exposed by street
manager will attempt to validate the JWT as part of its authentication and
authorisation function.
{: .govuk-body}

The ID token expires 1 hour after it was generated, if an expired JWT is used in a
request, an error with the HTTP status `401` will be returned.  In this scenario
a new token will need to be generated using the <code>/party/refresh</code>
endpoint by supplying a Refresh token.
{: .govuk-body}

To invalidate all JWT tokens associated with a user, the Access token should be provided
to the <code>/party/logout</code> endpoint.
{: .govuk-body}

### Resource
{: .govuk-heading-m}

<code>POST /authenticate</code>

The authenticate endpoint takes a case sensitive username (email
address) and password, returning JWT ID, Access and Referesh tokens if successful.
**The JWT ID and Access tokens are valid for one hour, meanwhile the Refresh token
is valid for 1 day.** Once the ID token has been acquired it can be added to all
protected resource requests made via swagger using the Authorize button.
{: .govuk-body}

![authorise](images/authorise.png)

When clicked this will present an input to enter the token. Once
authorized then all protected resource requests made via swagger will
have the token header set.
{: .govuk-body}

![available authorisations](images/available-authorisations.png)

If authenticating for the first time with a temporary password, a 307 Temporary
Redirect to <code>authenticate/initial</code> will be returned, which can be called
with the same request body.
{: .govuk-body}

<code>POST /authenticate/initial</code>

After a user has been invited to the system by their organisation admin, they need to set a new password. This
endpoint can be called with a new user's email address and temporary password, and will
return a token that should be provided to the Party API <code>/set-password</code> endpoint.
{: .govuk-body}

### Error responses
{: .govuk-heading-m}

It's important to distinguish between authentication and authorization
error responses as it will help narrow down where an issue is occurring.
{: .govuk-body}

### Authentication Failed
{: .govuk-heading-m}

<code>{ "message": "Authentication failed", "error": { "status": 401 } }</code>

Authentication fails when the token provided in the request is invalid.
The ID token may have expired or the value set as the token was incorrect.
You may also see this error when calling the POST /authenticate endpoint
with invalid credentials i.e. wrong username or password.
{: .govuk-body}

### Access Restricted
{: .govuk-heading-m}

<code>{ "message": "Access restricted", "error": { "status": 401 } }</code>

The access restricted error indicates that although the token was valid,
the user does not have permissions to perform the desired action. This
error could arise for several reasons which will be listed in detail as
part of the resource section, but common triggers would be attempting to
manipulate entities (permit, reinstatement, inspection etc.) not related
to your organization.
{: .govuk-body}

### Rate limiting
{: .govuk-heading-m}

To protect the system from denial of service attacks, repeated calls
made in a short period of time from a single IP source will receive 429
status responses. If you are receiving 429 responses ensure you are not
sending an excessive number of calls.
{: .govuk-body}

Note that rate limiting thresholds will be under regular review and
refinement during the Public Beta. The final Production values
will be confirmed prior to entering Public Beta.

## Sequencing
{: .govuk-heading-l #sequencing}

As detailed in the Technical Overview section, the reporting API drives
a large amount of data retrieval functionality whilst the Street Manager
API drives a lot of key user workflows e.g. submit permit, assess
permit, etc. These two APIs together form much of the common sequences a
user is likely to perform.
{: .govuk-body}

Below is an example of sequence calls used to submit and respond to a
permit application as well as how various actions affect the works
lifecycle. These endpoints are all available as part of the street
manager API and are discussed in more detail within the resource guide.
{: .govuk-body}

![sequence diagram](images/sequence-calls-used-to-submit-and-respond-to-a-permit-application.png)

The following actions can be performed at any subsequent stage in the
sequence from the stage they are available:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>File upload</li>
  <li>Add a comment</li>
  <li>Add reinstatement</li>
  <li>Add inspections</li>
  <li>Make alteration</li>
</ol>

Whilst the above focuses much on data manipulation via the Work API, here is an example of some data retrieval calls that may be performed alongside these actions via the reporting API.
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><strong>Permits awaiting assessment</strong>: <code>GET /permits?status=submitted</code></li>
  <li><strong>Expiring interim reinstatements</strong>: <code>GET /reinstatements?status=interim&latest_reinstatements_only=true</code></li>
  <li><strong>Disputed FPNs</strong>: <code>GET /fixed-penalty-notices?status=disputed</code></li>
</ol>

### Understanding the status of a work
{: .govuk-heading-m}

As a permit progresses through the sequence above the permit status
changes. Knowing the various statuses of a work and a permit allows you to filter
lists of permits related to your organization through the reporting API.
{: .govuk-body}

The statuses of a work are:

### Viewing works and permits
{: .govuk-heading-m}

#### Work API
{: .govuk-heading-s}

When a permit has been submitted and a works record exists both
promoters and HAs can view the works record via the GET work endpoint on
the work API. This endpoint requires you to provide the **work
reference number** which was supplied during the submission of the
permit application.
{: .govuk-body}

<code>GET /works/{work reference number}</code>

This contains information about all of the entities associated with the
work record, the properties of this response are:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><strong>Active permit</strong>: The currently active permit associated with the works. In the sequence above this would contain the permit awaiting assessment</li>
  <li><strong>Forward plan</strong>: Summary of a forward plan if it has been added to the works (none initially)</li>
  <li><strong>Sites</strong>: Any reinstatement sites that have been added to the works (none initially)</li>
  <li><strong>Inspections</strong>: Any inspections that have been issued on the works (none initially)</li>
  <li><strong>FPNs</strong>: Any fixed penalty notices that have been issued on the works (none initially)</li>
  <li><strong>Permits</strong>: Summary of all permits that have been associated with that works (i.e. multiple permits)</li>
  <li><strong>Reinstatements</strong>: Summary of all reinstatements that have been associated with that works (none initially)</li>
  <li><strong>History</strong>: Summary of all history associated with that works</li>
  <li><strong>Files</strong>: Any files that have been uploaded on the works (none initially)</li>
</ol>

It's also possible to retrieve only information about the permit itself
using the GET permit endpoint. This endpoint requires you to provide the
**permit reference number** which is returned in the response of the
permit application submission. As detailed in the submit permit
application section of the resource guide, the permit reference number
is simply the works reference number suffixed by an incrementing number
e.g. {WRN}-01 for the first permit added to that work.
{: .govuk-body}

<code>GET /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}</code>

#### Reporting API
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The reporting API permits endpoint will be the most useful way to see
all permits that are relevant to your organisation.
{: .govuk-body}

For example, as an HA you can use the **status** property of a permit
indicates the current state it is in, for submitted permits that are
awaiting assessment the permit status will be "submitted".
{: .govuk-body}

<code>GET /permits?status=submitted</code>

The **status** query param can be changed to any of the values discussed
above to retrieve permits in any stage of the sequence. This is
discussed in more detail in the reporting API resource guide.
{: .govuk-body}

Promoters can use **status** values to find permits which the HA has
responded to, see the Street Manager API resource guide for more details
on Permit status values.
{: .govuk-body}

### Permits
{: .govuk-heading-m}

In order to carry out much of the actions against a work record the associated permit must be submitted and granted:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <strong>Create a work record (Planner)</strong>: <code>POST /works</code>
    <p>
      Initially a promoter will create a work, which will, in turn, create a
      permit application.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Approve the permit (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}/status</code>
    <p>
      As per the usual permit flow, if the work isn't an immediate, the Highway
      Authority will need to grant the application before work can begin.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

![permit create and assess diagram](images/create-and-assess-permits.png)

#### Permit modification requests
{: .govuk-heading-s}

HA Officers will have the option to assess permit applications as a `permit_modification_request`. This means the work can not be started until the HA makes a final assessment, i.e. `granted` or `refused`. They can do this at any time, but the promoter will have the option to submit permit alterations in order to address the changes the HA has asked for.
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <strong>Create a work record (Planner)</strong>: <code>POST /works</code>
    <p>
      Initially a promoter will create a work, which will, in turn, create a
      permit application.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Modification request (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}/status</code>
    <p>
      Via the assessment endpoint, the HA requests changes to the permit.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Create permit alteration (Promoter)</strong>: <code>POST /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}/alterations</code>
    <p>
      Promoter submits requested changes via change request
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assess the alteration (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>PUT /works/{workReferenceNumber}/permits/{permitReferenceNumber}/alterations/{permitAlterationReferenceNumber}/status</code>
    <p>
      Once a permit alteration is submitted the Highway Authority can either grant or refuse it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a permit alteration is granted by a Highway Authority the permit is updated with the altered values.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Approve or reject the permit (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}/status</code>
    <p>
      The HA makes a final assessment decision on the permit
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
![permit modification request diagram](images/permit-modification-request.png)


### Inspections
{: .govuk-heading-m}

In order to create an inspection the following steps should be followed:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <strong>Create a work record (Planner)</strong>: <code>POST /works</code>
    <p>
      Initially a promoter will create a work, which will, in turn, create a
      permit application.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Approve the permit (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}/status</code>
    <p>
      As per the usual permit flow, if the work isn't an immediate, the Highway
      Authority will need to grant the application before work can begin.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Start the work (Planner)</strong>: <code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/start</code>
    <p>
      As per the usual permit flow, if the work isn't an immediate, the Highway
      Authority will need to grant the application before work can begin.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Upload supporting evidence (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>POST /files</code>
    <p>
      If supporting evidence is required for an inspection (for example, a
      photograph of a defect) one or more files can be associated with the
      inspection as part of the POST request. The file(s) must be uploaded
      first, the returned <code>file_id</code> submitted in the
      <code>file_ids</code> array in the inspecion request and the
      <code>inspection_evidence</code> boolean set to <code>true</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Create an inspection (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>POST /works/{work reference number}/inspections</code>
    <p>
      Once a permit is in the "In Progress" or "Closed" state an inspection can
      be recorded against it. When recording a Failed inspection it is possible
      to create a reinspection which will act as a placeholder for a follow up
      inspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once an inspection is recorded against a work any previously scheduled
      reinspections, for that work, will be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once an inspection is recorded against a work it cannot be updated.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

![Inspections sequence diagram](images/inspections-wsd.png)

### Fixed Penalty Notices
{: .govuk-heading-m}

In order to create a fixed penalty notice the following steps should be
followed:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <strong>Create a work record (Planner)</strong>: <code>POST /works</code>
    <p>
      Initially a promoter will create a work, which will, in turn, create a
      permit application.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Upload supporting evidence (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>POST /files</code>
    <p>
      If supporting evidence is required for a fixed penalty notice (for
      example, a photograph of a breach of conditions) one or more files can be
      associated with the inspection as part of the POST request. The file(s)
      must be uploaded first, the returned <code>file_id</code> submitted in the
      <code>file_ids</code> array in the inspecion request and the
      <code>fpn_evidence</code> boolean set to <code>true</code>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Create a fixed penalty notice (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>POST /works/{work reference number}/fixed-penalty-notices</code>
    <p>
      A fixed penalty notice can be created against a work as soon as it has
      been created.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accept a fixed penalty notice (Planner)</strong>: <code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/fixed-penalty-notices/{fpn reference number}/status</code>
    <p>
      Optional Step: A promoter can mark the fixed penalty notice as accepted
      or, alternatively, they can pay it offline.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Dispute a fixed penalty notice (Planner)</strong>: <code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/fixed-penalty-notices/{fpn reference number}/status</code>
    <p>
      Optional Step: A promoter can dispute a fixed penalty notice. Once a
      promoter disputes a fixed penality notice, they are able to retroactively
      mark it as accepted, if required.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Set fixed penalty notice outcome (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/fixed-penalty-notices/{fpn reference number}/status</code>
    <p>
      The Highway Authority issuing the fixed penalty notice is able to
      record the resolution of the fixed penality notice. Possible resolution
      states are: Paid, Paid with Discount or Withdrawn.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

![FPN sequence diagram](images/fpn-wsd.png)

### Sites and reinstatements
{: .govuk-heading-m}

Reinstatements can be created as part of a non-notifiable work record or a planned work record. Reinstatement and sites have the following types:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    excavation
  </li>
  <li>
    bar_holes
  </li>
  <li>
    core_holes
  </li>
  <li>
    pole_testing
  </li>
</ol>

The type is only specified when creating a site, any reinstatements created an against existing site will inherit the type from the site they are created against. Excavation sites can only be created for work records which have an active permit which is in-progress or complete and where excavation is set to true in the permit application. A typical flow is as follows:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <strong>Create a work record (Planner)</strong>: <code>POST /works</code>
    <p>
      Initially a promoter will create a work, which will, in turn, create a
      permit application. Excavation will be true when promoter wishes to raise excavation sites
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Approve the permit (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}/status</code>
    <p>
      As per the usual permit flow, if the work isn't an immediate, the Highway
      Authority will need to grant the application before work can begin.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Start the work (Planner)</strong>: <code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/start</code>
    <p>
      As per the usual permit flow, if the work isn't an immediate, the Highway
      Authority will need to grant the application before work can begin.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Create a site (Planner)</strong>: <code>POST /works/{workReferenceNumber}/sites</code>
    <p>
      Once a permit is in the "In Progress" or "Closed" state a site can
      be created.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a site is recorded against a work a reinstatement of the same type can be optionally added to the site using <code>POST /works/{workReferenceNumber}/sites/{siteNumber}/reinstatements</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a site/reinstatement is recorded against a work it cannot be updated.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Assess the alteration (Highway Authority)</strong>: <code>PUT
/works/{workReferenceNumber}/permits/{permitReferenceNumber}/alterations/{permitAlterationReferenceNumber}/status</code>
    <p>
      Once a permit alteration is submitted the Highway Authority can either grant, grant with duration challenge or refuse it. If the Highway Authority grants with duration challenge they also provide an alternative end_date for the work to be complete.
    </p>
    <p>

## Resource Guide
{: .govuk-heading-l #resource-guide}

### Reporting API
{: .govuk-heading-m}

As discussed in the sequencing section, the reporting API allows
promoters and HAs to query resource lists for their organization,
filtering them by various properties. The reporting API currently allows
users to retrieve the following:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#get-permits">Permits</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#get-inspections">Inspections</a></li>
  <li>Comments</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#get-fpns">Fixed penalty notices</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#get-reinstatements">Reinstatements</a></li>
  <li>Workstreams</li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#polling">Work updates (polling endpoint)</a></li>
  <li><a class="govuk-link" href="#get-inspections">Inspections</a></li>
</ol>

#### Pagination
{: .govuk-heading-s}

Most endpoints on the reporting API are driven with pagination. This
is controlled by the <strong>offset</strong> query param,
which indicates the starting point from which to return data.
{: .govuk-body}

Each paginated response in the reporting API contains the following meta-data:
{: .govuk-body}

<code>{ "pagination": { "has_next_page": true, "total_rows": "50" }, "rows": [...] }</code>

The <strong>has_next_page</strong> and <strong>total_rows</strong> properties indicate if
additional pages of results are available to be returned, in the context of the total number
of rows (records).
{: .govuk-body}

The <strong>total_rows</strong> property can return a maximum number of <strong>501</strong>,
if 501 is returned it indicates that there may be more rows available in the database to query.
This is confirmed if <strong>has_next_page</strong> is <strong>true</strong>, and means that if
there are more than 501 rows, and the offset is greater than 501, additional rows will be returned,
but the total_rows property will still be limited to 501 rows.
{: .govuk-body}

The rows property contains the records for the
current page.
{: .govuk-body}

By default, there are a maximum of 25 rows returned per page. Therefore, in the
example above, if you have 50 items total with 25 items per page, to
get the next page of results the offset should be set to 25.
The next response would contain rows 26-50.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Organisation specific data

### **Work API**
{: .govuk-heading-m}

#### Work records and permits
{: .govuk-heading-s}

It's important to clarify the technical relationship between a work and a permit. When creating a permit for the first time, this will in effect create a works record. A work can have multiple permits. You can create a work and a permit at the same time, or you can create a permit against an existing work depending on the work records current status. A work cannot exist without a permit.
{: .govuk-body}

There is also a concept of a work record's active permit, that is simply the most recently added permit on that works record. In essence, a work is a representation of all the permits, reinstatements, FPNs, inspections etc. that have been added to a particular location.
{: .govuk-body}

### Delegated Users
{: .govuk-heading-s #delegated-users}

All POST and PUT endpoints will contain two properties, internal_user_identifier and internal_user_name, these are intended to allow external systems to pass their internal users identifiers to Street Manager so that they are recorded against actions performed via the API (e.g. displaying the internal users name against a Street Manager comment).
{: .govuk-body}

#### Create work endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /works</code>

This endpoint takes all the information required to create a permit, as well as some key identification information about the works record as a whole.
{: .govuk-body}

If the user supplies a work_reference_number as part of the request body to POST /works then it must only contain alphanumeric characters, dashes ('-' - Unicode number U+002D) and underscores ('_' - Unicode number U+005F). If the user does not supply a work_reference_number then it will be auto-generated with the following format:<br/>
<br/>
<code><2 letter swa_org_prefix><3-letter workstream prefix><8 digit random number></code><br/>
<br/>
The generated work_reference_number is returned in the response.
{: .govuk-body}

The promoter_swa_code and highway_authority_swa_code are particularly important fields in the request. Currently only a promoter can create a permit and works record so the promoter SWA code provided in the request much match that of the user authenticated to the system. This is determined by the token header of the request, which contains the JWT. In effect this means the promoter can only add a work or permit for their own organisation.
{: .govuk-body}

All SWA codes are left-padded to 4 digits, so for example if the SWA code of your promoter organisation is 10, this should be entered as "0010".
{: .govuk-body}

As a promoter, the HA SWA code you choose is the organisation which will be associated with the permit, and thus responsible for assessing the permit. This HA will also be the only organisation able to add inspections or issue FPNs against the work record. Although generally most information in the system is viewable by any organisation, only the HA and promoter responsible for the work can make actions against it.
{: .govuk-body}

You may provide a workstream_prefix, which corresponds to the workstream with
which you would like to associate the works. A default workstream with prefix
"000" exists for every organisation. If you do not explicitly provide a
workstream_prefix, the works are associated with your organisation's default
workstream. The workstream_prefix must match the prefix of a workstream
associated with the user's organisation.
{: .govuk-body}

NSG related fields are optional. If not provided; street_name, area_name and road_category will be inferred from NSG data relating to the provided USRN. Use Street Lookup API endpoint /nsg/streets or /nsg/usrn to lookup this information.
{: .govuk-body}

permit_asds for the provided USRN can be found at Street Lookup API endpoint /nsg/usrn
{: .govuk-body}

#### Create permit endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /works/{work reference number}/permits</code>

This endpoint is used to add a new permit to an existing works. There are two main journeys that this endpoint can be used for:

##### Raise an additional permit on a works

A work can have multiple permits associated with it so it possible to add a new permit to an existing works. This endpoint requires some of the same fields as the create work request but much of the information from the first permit will be used as the value for additional permits, and so only a subset of information is required.
{: .govuk-body}

It's not possible to add an additional permit to an existing works, unless the work is in an inactive state. The state of the work is derived by the status of the most recently added permit. So in short, an additional permit can only be added to a work if the most recently added permit on the existing works record has a status of closed, cancelled, refused or revoked.
{: .govuk-body}

##### Progress a forward plan to a PAA

When a forward plan is created, a works is created with no permits. In this scenario, this endpoint is used to raise the first permit on the works. This permit will always be a PAA. This endpoint requires some of the same fields as the create forward plan request but much of the information from the forward plan will be used as the value for the PAA, and so only a subset of information is required.
{: .govuk-body}

In order to progress a forward plan to a PAA, the forward plan must have a status of "raised". Upon successful progression, the forward plan's status will be updated to "closed".
{: .govuk-body}

#### Update status endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference
number}/status</code>

The sequence section shows how a permit can be assessed and actioned at various stages by promoters and highway authorities. This endpoint drives all of these functions.
{: .govuk-body}

A permit can only be actioned by the promoter and highway authority organisation it is associated with, these are specified when creating the work record.
{: .govuk-body}

#### On site (start/stop works)
{: .govuk-heading-s}

Once a permit has been submitted and granted by an HA, the promoter which raised the permit is able to:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Start a work</li>
  <li>Stop a work</li>
  <li>Provide inspection units</li>
  <li>Update Final site registered</li>
</ol>

These actions control various stages of the works record life cycle as shown in the sequencing section.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Start work endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/start</code>

When a permit is submitted initially, a proposed start and end date for the work must be provided. The start endpoint is then used to provide the date the work has actually began, and thus officially starting the work.
{: .govuk-body}

By setting an actual start date, the active permit's status will change to in-progress. This allows the promoter to add reinstatements against the works record if an excavation was carried out and it also allows highway authority users to add inspections, which will be covered in separate sections.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Revert start work endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/revert-start</code>

If a permit has been started accidentally, it can be reverted using this endpoint. This will remove the actual start date and change the active permit's status back to proposed.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Stop work endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/stop</code>

When a permit is submitted initially, a proposed start and end date for the work must be provided. The stop endpoint is then used to provide the date the work has actually ended, and thus officially stopping the work.
{: .govuk-body}

By setting an actual stop date via this endpoint, the active permit's status will change to closed. It's still possible to add reinstatements and inspections to closed works as they may be added retrospectively.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Revert stop work endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/revert-stop</code>

If a permit has been stopped accidentally, it can be reverted using this endpoint. This will remove the actual end date and change the active permit's status back to in-progress.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Inspection units endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/inspection-units</code>

You can only provide inspection units if a reinstatement currently exists on the works record. Adding a reinstatement is covered in a separate section.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Final reinstatement endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/final-reinstatement</code>

Once a permit is in progress, and an excavation site has been added to the work, a promoter can flag that the final site has been registered for that work. Adding a reinstatement is covered in a separate section.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Reinstatements (Promoter)
{: .govuk-heading-s}

As shown in the sequencing section, once a work has been started by the promoter then a promoter can add reinstatements and sites. A promoter can continue to create and view these even after the work has been stopped and completed, as they may need to do this retrospectively.
{: .govuk-body}

In a similar vein to the relationship between a works and a permit, it's important to clarify the technical relationship between a site and a reinstatement. When creating a reinstatement for the first time, this will in effect create a site record. A site can have multiple reinstatement. You can create a site and a reinstatement at the same time, or you can create a reinstatement against an existing site. A site cannot exist without a reinstatement. All reinstatements belonging to a site will be of the same type e.g. excavation
{: .govuk-body}

A site is a representation of all the reinstatements carried out at a particular location but the most recently added reinstatement reflects the sites properties.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Create site endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /works/{work reference number}/sites</code>

This endpoint takes all the information required to create a reinstatement, a successful request will create a site with an associated reinstatement.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Get site endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>GET /works/{work reference number}/sites/{site number}</code>

Once a site has been created it can be retrieved using the GET endpoint, passing the site number which is returned as part of the create request.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Create reinstatement endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /works/{work reference number}/sites/{site number}/reinstatements</code>

A site can have multiple reinstatements associated with it so it is possible to add a new reinstatement to an existing site. This endpoint requires all of the same fields as the create site request.
{: .govuk-body}

A reinstatement can be interim or permanent. If the most recently added reinstatement on a site is interim, then a new permit is required to be granted and started before that site can be made permanent.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Inspections (HA)
{: .govuk-heading-s}

As shown in the sequencing section, once a work has been started then an HA can issue an inspection. Similar to reinstatements, this can be done even after the works has been stopped and completed, in cases where the HA needs to do this retrospectively.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Create inspection endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /works/{work reference number}/inspections</code>

Creating an inspection will return a inspection reference number which can be used to retrieve an individual inspection via the GET endpoint provided.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Fixed Penalty Notices (HA)
{: .govuk-heading-s}

As shown in the sequencing section An HA user can issue a fixed penalty notice (FPN) against the work record at any point in the works life cycle. Promoters can view and dispute the FPN but they cannot issue their own. HA users may upload evidence to support their FPN but the workflow for this is explained in the file upload section.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Create FPN endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /works/{work reference number}/fixed-penalty-notices</code>

Creating a FPN will return a FPN reference number which can be used to retrieve the individual FPN via the GET endpoint provided.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Update FPN status endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/fixed-penalty-notices/{FPN reference
number}/status</code>

Both a promoter and HA can action FPNs in different ways as shown in the sequencing section. When an FPN is created by the HA it is considered issued. A promoter can accept or dispute FPNs, whilst an HA officer can mark an FPN as withdrawn or paid.
{: .govuk-body}

#### File upload
{: .govuk-heading-s}

Several flows discussed in the previous sections allow users to add files as part of their request:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <strong>Submit permit application:</strong> planners can upload traffic management plans
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Add reinstatement:</strong> planners can upload evidence of the reinstatement
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Issue an inspection:</strong> HA users can upload evidence as part of issuing failed inspection
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Issue a fixed penalty notice:</strong> HA users can upload evidence as part of issuing an FPN
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Works record:</strong> Both promoters and HA users can upload files to the work record
  </li>
</ol>

Uploading a file is achieved through the file upload endpoint. This endpoint is required as part of all the above flows as any files that the user wishes to associate with the above requests must first be uploaded using this endpoint.
{: .govuk-body}

*Note: The sequence for uploading files may change to allow drafting permits before uploading files.*
{: .govuk-body}

#### Upload file endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /files</code>

Once a file has been uploaded the response will contain a file ID. This is the unique identifier of the file in our system. Behind the scenes the file will be uploaded to S3 and virus scanned. This file ID can then be provided in the requests of the flows discussed above. Once a valid file ID is provided in the requests of the above flows, the file is then associated with the relevant entity.
{: .govuk-body}

One file can be uploaded at a time. This file cannot exceed 10MB.
{: .govuk-body}

The optional swaCode parameter is required for contractor users only. Contractors should provide the swaCode of the organisation they are working on behalf of.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Get file endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>GET /files/{file ID}</code>

Retrieves the file using the file ID.
{: .govuk-body}

As the file is virus scanned at the point of upload, it is not immediately available for retrieval. It's possible that this endpoint could return a file not found error response if the file has not yet been virus scanned and marked as safe or if the file was deemed unsafe and removed from the system.
{: .govuk-body}

Typically the virus scanning process will only take a few seconds.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Delete file endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>DELETE /files/{file ID}</code>

Deletes a file from the system. Users can only delete files which their organisation uploaded. You cannot remove a file that's been linked to an entity. As soon as the file id is used as part of a create permit/reinstatement/FPN/inspection request then it is considered linked to that entity.
{: .govuk-body}

#### History
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>GET /works/{work reference number}/history</code>

The history endpoint returns audit events associated with that works record such as when a permit is assessed, a comment is added etc.
{: .govuk-body}

Audit events in the history response will include a <code>topic</code> property to indicate what type of object triggered this audit. The <code>topic</code> property may conatin one of following:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><strong>Application</strong>: A permit action prior to assessment</li>
  <li><strong>Permit</strong>: A permit action once it has been granted</li>
  <li><strong>PAA</strong>: A permit action when it has a work_category of paa</li>
  <li><strong>ChangeRequest</strong>: A permit alteration action</li>
  <li><strong>FPN</strong>: A fixed penalty notice action</li>
  <li><strong>Reinstatement</strong>: A site or reinstatement action</li>
  <li><strong>Inspection</strong>: An inspection action</li>
  <li><strong>ScheduledInspection</strong>: A scheduled inspection action</li>
  <li><strong>Work</strong>: A work record action i.e. uploading a file</li>
  <li><strong>ForwardPlan</strong>: A forward plan action</li>
  <li><strong>Comment</strong>: Logging a comment</li>
  <li><strong>Section81</strong>: A section 81 action</li>
</ol>

Note that the <code>topic</code> property is subject to change. A more reliable option is the <code>event</code> enum property that details what specific action trigger the audit. See the <code>AuditEvent</code> enum in the Work API Swagger definition for a full list of possible events in Street Manager.
{: .govuk-body}

Audit events in the history response will also include an object_reference. Where further information is required about what has changed this object_reference can be used to find more details on the object.
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><strong>Logging an Inspections</strong>: Inspection Reference Number</li>
  <li><strong>Applying for a Permit</strong>: Permit Reference Number</li>
  <li><strong>HA granting a permit applicaiton</strong>: Permit Reference Number</li>
  <li><strong>Permit application deeming</strong>: Permit Reference Number</li>
  <li><strong>Requesting a change</strong>: Change Request Reference Number</li>
  <li><strong>Creating a site or reinstatement</strong>: Site Number</li>
  <li><strong>Raising a FPN</strong>: FPN Reference Number</li>
  <li><strong>Adding or removing a File to a work record</strong>: File ID</li>
  <li><strong>Updating on site details of a work</strong>: Permit Reference Number</li>
</ol>

As well as viewing comments on a work record level, you can also call the reporting API comments endpoint to retrieve all comments associated with your users organization. See the Reporting API section of the resource guide.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Permit Alterations
{: .govuk-heading-s}

Permit alterations allows promoters and HA users the ability to alter a permit once it's been created. Not all properties of a permit are changeable and thus depending on what's been changed and by who, the type of permit alterations are:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>
    <strong>Promoter change request:</strong> Promoter submitted alteration after permit has been granted or in-progress
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Promoter imposed change:</strong> Promoter submitted alteration before permit has been granted or in response to a permit modification request.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Work extension:</strong> Promoter submitted proposed end date alteration to in-progress work
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>HA imposed change:</strong> HA users impose changes to permit conditions after permit is granted or in-progress
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>HA change request:</strong> Currently in the roadmap for future release (post April 2020)
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Duration challenge:</strong> A work extension which has been challenged by the HA with a reasonable_period_end_date
  </li>
</ol>

Creating an alteration will return a alteration reference number which can be used to retrieve an individual alteration via the GET endpoint provided.
{: .govuk-body}

While HA imposed changes are applied to the permit automatically, promoter change requests need to be granted (or deemed) before the changes are applied to the target permit.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Create alteration endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}/alterations</code>

Creates a permit alteration. The model takes all editable fields on the permit. When a promoter uses this endpoint, the alteration will have an AlterationType of PROMOTER_CHANGE_REQUEST in the case that they do not extend the end date of the permit while it in in progress, or WORK_EXTENSION in the case that they do. Once the alteration is create it is required to be assessed by the associated HA.
{: .govuk-body}

A HA can use this endpoint to impose changes. The HA must provide all details of the permit with changes only to the conditions section. The AlterationType in this case will be HA_IMPOSED_CHANGE. When an HA imposes a change that change is automatically applied to the permit. It will continue to have a status of Submitted but the permit will reflect the changes submitted.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Update alteration status endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}/alterations/{permit alteration reference number}/status</code>

The sequence section shows how an alteration can be assessed and actioned at various stages by promoters and highway authorities. This endpoint drives all of these functions.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Get alteration endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>GET /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}/alterations/{permit alteration reference number}</code>

This alteration endpoint returns both the original and the proposed changes of a permit in addition to the reason for the alteration, assessment information and other information relevant to the alteration.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Permit Discount
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}/permit-discount</code>

This alteration endpoint allows a HA to amend permit discounts applied and reason after assessment.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Acknowledge HS2 applications endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/permits/{permit reference number}/hs2_acknowledgement</code>

This endpoint allows HAs to acknowledge a HS2 consultation application.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Events and Activities
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /activity</code>

<code>GET /activity/{activity reference number}</code>

<code>PUT /activity/{activity reference number}/cancel</code>

Events or Activities allow a HA to represent different activites within Street Manager. There are 13 activity types currently supported by Street Manager:
{: .govuk-body}

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
 <li>Highway improvement works</li>
 <li>Highway repair and maintenance works</li>
 <li>Utility asset works</li>
 <li>Utility repair and maintenance works</li>
 <li> Diversionary Works</li>
 <li>Disconnection or alteration of supply</li>
 <li>Permanent reinstatement</li>
 <li>Remedial works</li>
 <li>Section 58</li>
 <li>Section 50</li>
 <li>Core Sampling</li>
 <li>Statutory Infrastructure Works</li>
 <li>Works for Rail Purposes</li>
</ol>

Creating an activity using the POST endpoint will return an activity reference number which can be used to retrieve an individual activity via the GET endpoint provided
{: .govuk-body}

Activities can be flagged as being cancelled by HA which initially raised the activity. The activity reference number is required. Optionally a reason for cancelling the activity can be provided. Activites are cancelled via the PUT endpoint provided.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Forward Plans
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /forward-plans</code>

<code>GET /works/{work reference number}/forward-plans/{forward plan reference number}</code>

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/forward-plans/{forward plan reference number}</code>

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/forward-plans/{forward plan reference number}/cancel</code>

Forward plans allow a Planner to supply information about road or street works in their longterm programme, which may include those works in their annual operating programme, or three or five year rolling programmes. Giving advance notice with a forward plan helps with collaboration of works. Forward plans are only for major works and can only be progressed to a PAA.
{: .govuk-body}

The POST endpoint will create a forward plan and return a work reference number and a forward plan reference number, which can be used to retrieve an individual forward plan via the GET endpoint provided.
{: .govuk-body}

The GET endpoint will require the work reference number and forward plan reference number of the intended forward plan to return information.
{: .govuk-body}

There are two PUT endpoints, one to update and one to cancel the forward plan.
{: .govuk-body}

The first PUT endpoint will update a forward plan and will require a work reference number, forward plan reference number and a minimum of the mandatory information that you wish to update.
{: .govuk-body}

The second PUT endpoint (labeled 'cancel') will cancel the forward plan, and subsequently, the work it superseeds. This will require a work reference number, forward plan reference number and a cancellation reason.
{: .govuk-body}

There is no versioning available when updating information, so information changed is lost.
{: .govuk-body}

#### Section 81s
{: .govuk-heading-s}

<code>POST /section-81-works/section-81s</code>

<code>GET /works/{work reference number}/section-81s/{section 81 reference number}</code>

<code>PUT /works/{work reference number}/section-81s/{section 81 reference number}/status</code>

## Roadmap
{: .govuk-heading-l #roadmap}

The Street Manager roadmap shows the things we’re working on and when we hope to have them ready for you to use. To see the full service roadmap refer to the DfT roadshow slides. Below are some details on planned API changes, detail on when they will be released and API changes will be available during public beta.
{: .govuk-body}

Street Manager is in public beta. This means it is still in active development and we’re regularly adding new features. The roadmap is a guide to what we have planned, but some things might change.
{: .govuk-body}

You can <a href="mailto:streetmanager@dft.gov.uk">contact us</a> for more detail about these features, or to suggest something else you’d like Street Manager to offer.
{: .govuk-body}

### Reporting API enhancements for search and filtering
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The Reporting API will be updated to allow additional search and filtering options, such as ability to query permit data from other organisations. The summary data returned will be increased to allow more flexible reporting and extracting data.
{: .govuk-body}

### Delegated user details fields for POST/PUT endpoints for comments/history
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The Work API will allow External systems which integrate with Street Manager to supply internal user identifer details in API calls from their own systems so that their actions in Street Manager can be distinguished from other internal users sent via API. This will be recorded and displayed in areas such as Comments and Works History.
{: .govuk-body}

The fields to be used for this have already been added to the Work API as placeholders for integration, see the **Swagger JSON** and **Resource Guide** for details.
{: .govuk-body}

### Returning transaction IDs on updates and use in polling endpoint
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The Reporting API continuous polling will be updated to allow the use of Transaction ID for filtering for easier polling.
{: .govuk-body}


### Notifications
{: .govuk-heading-s}

See **Technical Overview - Getting data from Street Manager - Notifications** for details.
{: .govuk-body}

*Note: Notifications are currently in roadmap for future release (post April 2020).*
{: .govuk-body}

### User and organisation self registration
{: .govuk-heading-s}

API will support user and organisation administration and registration functions, as such password reset, profile editing and user self registriction. These functions will be exposed via a new Party API, which will allow API users with admin permissions to
{: .govuk-body}

### Noticing
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The Work API will be updated to allow submission of notices to noticing Highway Authorities.
{: .govuk-body}

### Error correction
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The Work API will be updated to include endpoints for correcting errors in submitted data against works.
{: .govuk-body}

### Data Export API
{: .govuk-heading-s}

The Data Export API will be updated to export other data, including forward plans and activities.
{: .govuk-body}

This can now be updated using the new <code>PUT /works/{workReferenceNumber}/final-reinstatement</code> endpoint. Inspection units can now be updated so long as there is an existing site/reinstatement for a work, and will be audited individually using the existing inspection_units_logged audit event</li>
  <li>BREAKING CHANGE: <code>PUT /works/{workReferenceNumber}/excavation</code> removed. Promoters should now raise a permit alteration to update whether an excavation was carried out.</li>
  <li>BREAKING CHANGE: <code>site_id</code> and <code>permit_id</code> response fields have removed. These have been replaced with <code>site_number</code> and <code>permit_reference_number</code> respectively. The biggest impact of this change to when fetching the details of a site, the existing <code>GET /works/{workReferenceNumber}/sites/{siteId}</code> endpoint has been replaced with <code>GET /works/{workReferenceNumber}/sites/{siteNumber}</code></li>
