| Additional Street Data     | Additional Street Data (“ASD”) refers to extra information about a street that may affect works. This is part of the National Street Gazetteer (NSG) database, and includes things such as road centre lines, ownership details, level of reinstatement required, height, weight and width restrictions and direction of travel. This includes designations which identifies highly trafficked highways so that promoters know they must give greater advanced warning of proposed works or activities. Depending on circumstances, a designation may apply to the carriageway only, to a footway or pedestrian area only, or to any part of a length of street. Designations may only apply to certain times of day, days of the week, or days of the year. |
| Assessment period          | This is the time period that a Highway Authority (HA) has to assess and evaluate a permit application (or any other promoter request) prior to the permit deeming. The HA has the options to ‘Grant’, ‘Grant with Changes’ or ‘Refuse’.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Forward plan               | A forward plan (formerly known as a Forward Planning Information) can be used within Street Manager to help with the coordination and collaboration of works on the highway. A forward plan has no legal standing and will be amended accordingly once concrete works details are known and a PAA application is made. The forward plan will usually contain details of the street, the time period (quarter of a year) and a brief description of the works. A forward plan can be raised in the system at any time with a time period more than the minimum required for either a PAA or permit application.                                                                                                                                               |
