## 2. Workstreams

Before users start raising works in Street Manager, their organisation must set up their workstreams. These were previously known as ‘operational districts’.

The Street Manager system will, by default, create the prefix ‘000’ for every organisation. When organisations set up their workstreams, they can choose to allocate numerical prefixes between 1 - 999.
See works reference number (WRN) section for details on how the workstream prefix will be used when raising works.

x

_(Previously section 4.7 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_





**<span id="4-pa">4.x. Site number</span>**

* A new site will be added automatically when 'Add a reinstatement' is selected on the 'works record' level.



**<span id="4-pa">4.x. Add a reinstatement</span>**

* To add a reinstatement, the latest permit must be in 'In progress or 'Closed' status and require excavation.
* Reinstatement date must be:
  + the current date or in the past
  + on or before the actual end date if works stop has been logged
  + A user can only enter a reinstatement date until the works' 'Actual start date' has been logged. (WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?)
* To update a site with a new reinstatement, select 'Add another reinstatement' on the 'site record' level.
* All historical reinstatement details are available on the 'site record' page.
* This functionality may be used to correct a mistake on the previous reinstatement.
  + Note: if a mistake is made where the Reinstatement state 'Interim' is selected instead of 'permanent' as a new permit would be required to rectify this mistake. See the business rules regarding making an interim site permanent for more information.
