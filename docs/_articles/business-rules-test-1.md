<!-- ==================================================== -->
## 2. Workstreams
<!-- ==================================================== -->

Before users start raising works in Street Manager, their organisation must set up their workstreams. These were previously known as ‘operational districts’.

The Street Manager system will, by default, create the prefix ‘000’ for every organisation. When organisations set up their workstreams, they can choose to allocate numerical prefixes between 1 - 999.
See works reference number (WRN) section for details on how the workstream prefix will be used when raising works.

_(Previously section 15 & 15.1 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_


<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible" />



<!-- ==================================================== -->
## 3. Works submissions and applications
<!-- ==================================================== -->

### 3.1. Works reference number (WRN)

* The WRN is generated in the following format: {SWA prefix} {workstream prefix} {promoter works reference}
  * **SWA prefix** consists of two characters for the related organisation from the SWA code list.
  * **Workstream prefix** - See the workstream section for more details.
  * **Promoter works reference** - Between 1 to 19 characters generated by the Street Manager system or provided by the user.
* The WRN including the prefix must be unique in the Street Manager system e.g. the same organisation may have two works records with the same 'promoter works reference' if the works were created under two different workstreams.
* WRNs are not case-sensitive and displayed as uppercase.
* WRNs can only include the following special characters: dashes (-) or underscores (_) to separate characters
* Works records and WRNs are created automatically alongside other records such as forward plans and permit applications.

_(Previously section 1.1 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_  




<br />

### 3.2. Works statuses

< insert diagram >


<br />

### 3.3. Forward plans

* Forward plans are for giving advance notice of major works only.
* It is only possible to add forward plans for a start date in the present or future, and with an end date in the future.
* Forward plans can be progressed to PAA, edited or cancelled while in the ‘Raised’ status. 
* All forward plan details can be edited with the exception of certain details, namely the workstream, the highway authority and the USRN.
* When progressed to a PAA, the forward plan's status automatically gets set to 'Progressed'.

<!-- ==================================================== -->
## 4. Change requests (CR)
<!-- ==================================================== -->

### 4.1. Change request reference number

* The change request reference number is generated in the following format: {permit reference number} -CR- {numerical suffix}
    * See the **permit reference number** section for more details.
    * Numerical suffix - A minimum of two numbers starting from 01 for the first change request created on the PA and counts up consecutively for each additional change request (i.e. -01, -02, -03 etc).

### 4.2. Change request types

* The change request types are as follows:

| Change request type | Available for | Criteria | Assessment required? |
|:--------------------|:---------------------|:---------|:------------------------|
| Promoter imposed change (modified application) | Promoter | PA is awaiting assessment | No |
| Promoter change request | Promoter |  PA in status 'Granted', 'In progress' or 'Modification Requested' | Yes |
| Works extension | Promoter | Same criteria as 'Promoter change request' and includes a change to the proposed end date | Yes |
| HA imposed change | HA | PA in status 'Granted' or 'In progress' | No |

* For promoter imposed and HA imposed change types, the changes made will be applied automatically to the PA with the change request record available to see what has changed historically, and these change request types are not chargeable.
* A PA's response period is not affected by promoter imposed changes (i.e. changes while the PA is awaiting assessment).
* A works extension change request may include other changes in addition to a change to the proposed end date.
* HA imposed change is currently limited to adding or removing conditions.
* Promoter change requests include the change requests submitted as a response to a 'modification request' assessment decision.

_(Previously section 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 5.8 & 26 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_ 




### 4.3. Adding change requests

* Each PA may have only one change request awaiting assessment. 
* A change request may be added to PAs that are not 'Refused', 'Revoked' or 'Closed'
* The works category may be updated if the works duration is changed.
* Change requests may not be added to a PAA.
* The following cannot be changed on a PA: 
    * Permit reference number or works reference number
    * USRN
    * USRN address e.g. road/street
    * Road category
    * Primary notice authority the PA is submitted to
* Proposed start date may not be changed if works start has been logged.
* All change requests show the original details and changed values.

_(Previously section 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 & 5.6 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_ 





### 4.4. Change request assessment decision options

* The assessment decision options for change requests are as follows:

| Assessment decision | Applicable for CR type | Assessment decision impact |
|:------------------|:--------------------|:---|
| Grant | Promoter change request & works extension | Changes will be applied to the PA. |
| Refuse | Promoter change request & works extension | Changes will not be applied to the PA. Original PA will remain unchanged in status and contents i.e. the PA is not refused as a result of a change request assessment. | 
| Grant with duration challenge | Works extension | HA to provide a reasonable period end date and reason for the duration challenge. The new proposed end date, reasonable period end date and any other changes requested will be applied to the PA. |

* Note: Currently, granting or refusing a change request created as a response to 'modification request' will not grant or refuse the the related PA or affect it in any way. The PA will need to be assessed separately (changes to this are coming soon).


_(Previously section 5.1, 5.4 & 5.5 in Business rules v0.1 draft)_ 



### 4.5. Change request response period

* The response period for change requests is 2 working days. The change request will deem after this period and the changes will be applied to the PA.

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--xl govuk-section-break--visible" />









<!-- ==================================================== -->
## 5. Revoking a PA
<!-- ==================================================== -->

* HA may revoke a PA that has been granted and before works stop has been logged.
* If a PA is revoked 
    * before works start has been logged, the PA will remain in the final status of 'Revoked' where no further actions can be performed on the PA by the promoter.
    * after works start has been logged, the promoter may request a change, log works stop and add reinstatements.
    * with a change request awaiting assessment on a PA, the change request be revoked automatically.

### 6.5. Validity periods

* Only applicable for works on non-traffic sensitive category 3 or 4 roads.
    * Non-traffic sensitivity is determined either by there being no traffic-sensitive designations for the works' USRN or if there are, none were selected by the promoter as applicable to the works.
* If a works' actual start date is later than the proposed start date and within validity period, Street Manager will shift the proposed end date accordingly maintaining the same works duration as originally proposed starting from the actual start date.
* The validity periods for each works category are as follows (includes original start date):

| Works category | Validity period        |
|:---------------|:-----------------------|
| Major PAA      | Currently out of scope |

    * PAA progressed to PA - note, this occurs upon receipt of the PA, not when it is granted
    * Granting of a change request
    * A change in work category
* The maximum date range for the fee report is 31 calendar days.
* The fee report results are sorted by date of the chargeable transaction in ascending order.

* The following will be provided to support organisations calculating the fees due:
    * **Road category**
    * **Is street is traffic-sensitive** - are there any traffic-sensitive designations for the works' USRN?
    * **Is works is traffic-sensitive** - were any traffic-sensitive designations selected by the promoter on the PA?

* Note: The works category field will be populated with the PAA/PA's current works category at the time the report is run as opposed to showing the works category of the PAA/PA at the time the chargeable transaction took place.
* For example, if a PA is granted then soon after a work extension was also granted changing it from a standard to a major PA, there would be three transactions for this PA in the fee report:
    * granting of a PA
    * granting of a change request 
    * change in work category
    * The works category field for all three of these transactions will be 'major'

* Out of scope: inspection chargeable transaction ; fee amounts
