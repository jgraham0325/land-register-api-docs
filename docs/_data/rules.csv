3,1.1,,Works reference number (WRN),"Promoter has the option to use their own works reference number (WRN) or use an automatically-generated one by the Street Manager system. If the user opts for generating a WRN automatically, they will receive an 8-digit number that is made up of their organisation’s SWA code, and its allocated workstream prefix in Street Manager. The 8 digits in the WRN need to be unique as this is the distinguishing part, but these 8 digits can be the same for two permits if the works are allocated to another workstream (meaning the prefix will be different for each).


The WRN is generated in the following format and made up of these parts: {SWA_prefix} {workstream_prefix} - {Promoter works reference} - {StreetManager numerical record suffix}

The SWA prefix is from the SWA code list. The workstream prefix and promoter works reference are stored separately against the works record. While the numerical record suffix (-01, -02, -03 etc) counts up from 01 to reflect the number of permits that have already been raised.

When the user selects the option to automatically create the WRN, it is created and stored against the works record when the first permit application is submitted.

Manual WRNs are not case sensitive, but will be subsequently displayed as uppercase. System-generated WRNs are created in uppercase. Dashes (-) and underscores (_)  are the only special characters allowed in manually entered WRNs

4,1.2,,Permit reference number,"The permit reference number is a unique reference number, less than or equal to 30 characters, that is automatically generated by Street Manager (and unique within the system) at the end of the apply for a permit journey as part of the submission confirmation. This is also the number that the promoter needs to display on their on-site permit board.

Standard, Minor, Major (PAA) applications are able to be created from this flow. 

- Immediate 
(Unscheduled works of a critical nature that need to be undertaken without delay) Selecting this triggers progressive disclosure within the user interface of the question ""Is there a risk of damage to people or property?"" and saves the works category as Immediate – which triggers the Immediate permit application flow

- Minor, if the duration is 1 to 3 working days (inclusive)

8,1.6,,Working day,"Street Manager calculates working days based on bank holidays, public holidays, and weekends – not times. For example, the period from 00:00 - 16:30 is considered a working day. Any time before 16:30 is recorded as _that_ working day. Any time after 16:30 is considered the next working day.

****Note - currently the working day duration factors in bank holidays. However, as the Street Manager system receives bank holiday data from gov.uk up to the end of the following year, any works that extend beyond that won't be factoring in bank holidays****

10,1.8,,Deadline date,"The deadline date is the end of the response period, and forms part of the logic linked to deeming. For all application types, the clock starts counting down from the next working day after submission. Anything submitted after 16:30 is effectively the same as submitting them the next working day

The response periods for all types of applications before they deem are as follows‌:


- PAA - 28 calendar days 

- Major - 5 working days 

- Standard - 5 working days 

- Minor - 2 working days

- Immediate - 2 working days

- PAA - 3 months (12 calendar weeks/84 calendar days)
- Major - 10 working days
- Standard - 10 working days
- Minor - 3 working days

If the proposed start date is less than the notice period date, the promoter will be required to specify if they have pre-approval for an early start.

If they do have pre-approval the promoter is required to share the name of the person who agreed to the early start, together with any additional details. 
If they do not have pre-approval, the promoter is required to include justification for an early start request.

If change request submitted where proposed start date changed to be within the early start date range, user will be prompted to provide details of pre-approval. If they change the proposed start date to be beyond the early start date range, any previous pre-approval details entered as part of the permit application will be removed
",,,1
12,1.10,,Permit application deeming,"The deadline / response date are the same. This is the date by which the HA needs to respond to a permit application submission in order to avoid the permit deeming. 

The response periods for permit applications before deeming are as follows‌:

- PAA - 28 calendar days (clock starts ticking on following working day to submission as per other deeming logic for all other permits)

- Major - 5 working days 

- Standard - 5 working days 

- Minor - 2 working days

- Immediate - 2 working days 

Example scenario:
If a PAA is submitted on Tuesday at 14:00 it’ll deem in 28 calendar days, with the count starting from the next day (Wednesday), so Wednesday  is day 1, so Wednesday + 27 calendar days would be your deadline date
If this PAA was to be submitted after 16:30 on the same Tuesday, this effectively acts as through the PAA was submitted the next day, which means the response period is actually two days away, so same scenario different time:

1. Permit submitted Tuesday 16:31
2. Response period (we start counting from) Thursday

Users can only add another permit once the existing permit is no longer ""live"" i.e. it has been cancelled, revoked, refused or completed.

When adding a further permit to a works record, certain things cannot be changed. These include the works location (including coordinates and USRN) and the works reference number. For this reason, when adding a new permit to a works record, the map section of the permit journey is skipped and the user is first taken to the works location details page.
